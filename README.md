Automated-Tooth-Instance-Analysis is a deep learning project focused on developing a U-Net model for automated tooth segmentation in panoramic dental radiographs. The project combines computer vision and medical image analysis to detect and identify tooth boundaries from X-ray images, providing an automated solution to assist in dental diagnostics. The model is built and trained using Python and TensorFlow, enabling efficient processing of dental imaging data.
